# DailyDash

This repository functions as a versatile platform for experimenting with various technologies, including Docker, EJS, Google API and general web development methodologies.

Due to its experimental nature, this repository will not serve as an application for production use. Its primary purpose is to explore and test new concepts rather than provide a fully functional solution.
